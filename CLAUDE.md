# Analytics

- **Vercel Web Analytics** (`@vercel/analytics/next`) and **Speed Insights**
  (`@vercel/speed-insights/next`) are mounted in `app/layout.tsx`. Both are
  cookie-free / privacy-friendly, so they render unconditionally (outside the
  `CookieConsent` gate) and require no GDPR consent. Beacons hit
  `/_vercel/insights/view` and `/_vercel/speed-insights/vitals`.
- **GA4** (`G-W6NZ87CX2Q`) also runs, loaded `lazyOnload` via `next/script`
  with a synchronous inline `gtag` stub. The two analytics stacks are
  independent.

# Package manager

This repo has **both** `pnpm-lock.yaml` (v9) and `package-lock.json` committed.
The canonical manager is **pnpm** (Vercel detects `pnpm-lock.yaml` first, and
local `node_modules` carries pnpm's `.modules.yaml`). When adding deps: run
`pnpm add <pkg>`, then `npm install --package-lock-only` to keep
`package-lock.json` in sync. Don't `npm install` packages directly — it leaves
`pnpm-lock.yaml` stale and the dep won't install on deploy.
